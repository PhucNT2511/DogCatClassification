# Cat And Dog Classification Using CNN
## Data

## Model
I've just used a CNN model and sigmoid function in the final layer to decide whether an image is dog or cat. With 10 epochs, this program runs very fast, only in 15 minutes with GPUs.
The result is quiet good with the accuracy is about 90%.

## Thank you!!
